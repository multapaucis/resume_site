		<p class="card-text">Iâ€™m a Third Generation San Diegan, but have spent time living in D.C., Wyoming, and currently find my self in Colorado living my childhood dream of getting a season pass for Snowboarding.

		<p class="card-text">I have been making websites since I was 11 years old, writing in plain HTML on GeoCities. Since then I've learned a few more complicated methods for web design. Programming has always drawn me in because you can create something from nothing, there are always new things to learn, and there are also always ways to improve what you've already built. After years of programming in my spare time, I feel I'm finally ready to do it for a living.</p>
		<p class="card-text">Please take a look around my website. You'll find information on my work and education history, contact information, a GitHub link to see my portfolio, and even a PDF version of my resume if you prefer things old school.</p>
